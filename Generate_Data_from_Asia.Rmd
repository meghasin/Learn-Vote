In this file, we simulate obseravtional and interventional experiment from the synthetic network Asia from the bnlearn package. We conduct two experiment one generating asia_mut1 with one intervention amd asia_mut2 with two intervention. This is done in the same way to replicate the process of Sachs data generation. We also add unknown "fat-hand" intervention by changing values of one or more of the target node's children.

```{r}
# load the Asia dataset.
data(asia)
# create and plot the network structure.
dag_asia = model2network("[A][S][T|A][L|S][B|S][D|B:E][E|T:L][X|E]")
```

```{r}
#Sampling some observational data points from asia dataset
asia_mut1_obs = asia[sample(nrow(asia), 1600), ]

#intitializing additional column for Intervened target
Int_col = 0

#Adding the INT column
asia_mut1_obs$INT = Int_col
```

```{r}
#First we start by learning parameters of the Bayesian Network given the DAG
fitted = bn.fit(dag_asia, asia, method = "bayes")
```

Performing queries using gRain package on a mutilated Bayesian Network where we performed a perfect intervention by setting Lung cancer as "Yes". This is similar to a lab experiment where we intervene L like a knock-out experiment in the real world.

```{r}
#Adding perfect intervening at node "L" and fat-hand intervention at node "E"
asia_mut1_network = mutilated(fitted, evidence = list(L = "no", E = "yes"))
jmutilated = compile(as.grain(asia_mut1_network))

#Sampling experimental data
asia_mut1_exp = rbn(asia_mut1_network,400)

#Intitializing additional column for the known intervened target L
Int_col = 4

#Adding the INT column
asia_mut1_exp$INT = Int_col
```

```{r}
#Combining observation and experiment into one dataframe
asia_mut1 = rbind(asia_mut1_obs, asia_mut1_exp)
write.csv(asia_mut1,"data/Asia data/asia_mut1.csv")
```
